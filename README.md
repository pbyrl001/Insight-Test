# Insight Data Test

I attempted to follow through on the Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge. Basically, I got as far as importing the data and then exporting it imperfectly as a medianvals_by_zip.txt file and a medianvals_by_date.txt file. Through this exercise, I learned more about Python and how it operates. 

## Getting Started

You can just run the program as is with an input.txt file in your directory.

### Prerequisites

You will just need to have the CSV module and Pandas module installed on your computer.

### Running the Program

When having a constant stream of data being consistently updated in a input.txt file, you should be able to run the program and output two files: a medianvals_by_zip.txt file and a medianvals_by_date.txt file. The program essentially takes data from the input.txt file and uses the Panda groupby function and basic Python functions to rearrange and parse the data. The medianvals_by_zip.txt file will list the median values of the donor contributions by zip code. The medianvals_by_date.txt file will list median values of donor contributions by date.
